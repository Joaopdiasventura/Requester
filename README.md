<h1 align="center"> Requester</h1> <br/>

<p>This project was created to fill the need for a tool that tests APIs that is quick to start up and that means I don't need to log in every time I log in or need to create collections to be used.</p>
<p> In the most recent version (Requester-1.0.1) it is possible to test the "GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE" methods, receiving not only the response body, but also its status, and has a body checker that prevents to send requests that ask for a body without having a valid JSON.</p>

<p>The download is now available for Windows and Linux.</p>
